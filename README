My implementation of the CSV assignment relies on 3 classes: Main, CSV_Parser, and Object_Parser.
CSV_Parser takes in a reader object and returns a count-description of the file passed in, whereas
Object_Parser specifies the type of object that the CSV parser converts each row into. These two
were designed separately in accordance to their different functions: the former being both
end-user- and developer-centric and returning counts, and the later being only developer-centric
and returning a list of objects. To minimize the risk of bugs, I separated the two classes and their
respective functions. The Main class handles both of these classes and runs them, creating instances
of each according to user-set parameters.

There are no known bugs to my program — although it is important to note that I was unsure how to
test for the Object_Parser class and its respective method, so it is likely that there may
be some errors.

I made sure that the CSV_Parser class was thoroughly tested, and tried to account for edge cases
(empty CSV, no CSV) in my tests. The tests implemented ensure that the counts are all correct
and that the code in CSV_Parser can operate under different forms of inputs.

Running the tests is straightforward — the tests can be run individually on IntelliJ or collectively
and can all be found in the Tests.java file.
